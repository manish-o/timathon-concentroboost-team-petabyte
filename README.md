 Project Description- We have made an app that makes you focus on studies and has different study modes. There is a fun zone in app to relax the mind too as this app has been made to make one improve his/her performance. There is an AI based yawn detector to know when one is tired and requires some rest. The pomodoro technique is carefully applied to improve the overall study performance whereas the fun zone has been made for the person to enjoy. The focus mode is another mode of studying which include intense concentration without distraction and also has motivational quotes. This would help the user during his/her exam. The app is overall very creative, extraordinary and would prove to be very helpful in studies.

To run the App, you can use the setup installer to install the app(Windows Only) or downlaod the code and run main.py. The output folder is used for making the installer for the app.
Do use the app because it is pretty amazing at doing what we promised and we had a lot of fun and learning while making it.
